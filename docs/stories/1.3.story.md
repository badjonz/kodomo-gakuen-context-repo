# Story 1.3: Implement Bilingual Content for Core Page Sections

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** international family researching preschool options,  
**I want** all critical school information (Hero, About, Age Groups, Footer) to display in English when I select English language,  
**so that** I can understand the school's programs, philosophy, and contact information to make an informed enrollment decision.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Hero section** renders bilingual titles, subtitles, and button text from JSON content source while preserving existing Framer Motion animations and responsive design
2. **Age Groups section** displays translated program descriptions (乳児, 年少, 年中, 年長) and class information maintaining current card layouts and image associations
3. **About Information section** presents school philosophy, educational approach, and facility details in selected language with identical visual hierarchy and spacing
4. **Footer component** renders contact details, quick links, social media labels, and map information bilingually without breaking existing grid layout or external integrations
5. **Content synchronization** ensures Japanese and English versions display equivalent information with consistent messaging and cultural appropriateness
6. **Fallback handling** displays Japanese content if English translation is missing, preventing broken or empty content areas

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md#dev-agent-record, docs/stories/1.2.story.md#dev-agent-record]
- Language Context infrastructure is fully operational with useLanguage hook at `/src/context/LanguageContext.tsx`
- Content JSON structure exists at `/content/content.json` with comprehensive bilingual structure including hero, ageGroups, about, footer sections
- Header component successfully integrated with bilingual content switching using useSectionContent hook pattern
- Error boundaries and fallback mechanisms are operational from story 1.1
- Build process validates content structure during compilation
- Framer Motion animations work seamlessly with language changes using key={language} pattern

### Component Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/component-standards.md]
- Hero component location: `/src/components/sections/Hero.tsx` - supports both homepage and page-specific variants
- AgeGroups component location: `/src/components/sections/AgeGroups.tsx` - displays age-based class information in card format
- AboutInfo component location: `/src/components/sections/AboutInfo.tsx` - presents school philosophy and educational approach
- Footer component location: `/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` - contains contact information, quick links, and map integration
- Component naming convention: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- Props interface pattern: ComponentProps with TypeScript definitions
- Boolean props prefix: "is", "has", "can" - `isLanguageToggleVisible`

### State Management Integration
[Source: architecture/state-management.md]
- React Context API is the designated state management solution
- useLanguage hook provides: `{ language: 'ja' | 'en', toggleLanguage: () => void }`
- Language state persists throughout user session without localStorage
- No external state management libraries (Redux, Zustand) allowed
- Content loading follows established useSectionContent hook pattern from story 1.2

### Project Structure Compliance
[Source: architecture/project-structure.md]
- Hero component path: `/src/components/sections/Hero.tsx`
- AgeGroups component path: `/src/components/sections/AgeGroups.tsx`
- AboutInfo component path: `/src/components/sections/AboutInfo.tsx`
- Footer component path: `/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`
- Content structure path: `/content/content.json`
- Utility functions path: `/src/utils/cn.ts` for class merging
- Content loading hooks path: `/src/hooks/useContent.ts`

### Frontend Tech Stack Constraints
[Source: architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with tailwind-merge for intelligent class merging
- Animation: Framer Motion for declarative animations and transitions
- Build Tool: Next.js/Webpack with zero-config optimization
- Component Library: Custom components tailored to brand requirements
- No external UI libraries or frameworks beyond specified stack

### Content Structure Requirements
[Source: content/content.json structure analysis]
- Hero content structure: `content[language].hero.homepage` and `content[language].hero.pages[pageKey]`
- Age Groups content structure: `content[language].ageGroups` with sectionTitle, nyuuji, youji, star objects
- About content structure: `content[language].about` with sectionTitle, description, philosophy
- Footer content structure: `content[language].footer` with quickLinks, contact, social, location objects
- Image paths remain consistent across languages: `/images/nyuuji-pic.JPG`, `/images/youji-pic.JPG`, `/images/star-pic.JPG`

### Content Loading Hook Pattern
[Source: established pattern from story 1.2]
- useSectionContent hook signature: `useSectionContent(sectionName: string)`
- Hook returns content object for current language with automatic fallback
- Error handling included for missing sections or content loading failures
- Content validation during build process ensures structure completeness

### Mobile Responsiveness Requirements
[Source: architecture/component-standards.md, architecture/styling-guidelines.md]
- Mobile-first approach: `text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg`
- Breakpoint pattern: `hidden md:block` for desktop-only elements
- Responsive typography: `clamp(1.875rem, 4vw, 3rem)` for headings
- Grid layouts: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` for age groups cards
- Japanese typography support: `font-japanese` class for proper font rendering

### Animation Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]
- Framer Motion is the designated animation library
- Animation patterns: declarative, performance-optimized transitions
- Key prop pattern: `key={language}` to trigger re-animations on language change
- Avoid layout shifts during content switching
- Maintain existing transition timings: 0.3s duration with ease-in-out
- Staggered animations for list items and card grids

### Fallback Handling Strategy
[Source: architecture requirements and previous story patterns]
- Primary language fallback: Japanese content when English is missing
- Error boundary integration: Graceful degradation for content loading failures
- Build-time validation: Prevent deployment with incomplete content structure
- Runtime fallback: Display Japanese content immediately if English content fails to load
- User experience: No broken layouts or empty content areas under any circumstances

## Testing

### Testing Standards
