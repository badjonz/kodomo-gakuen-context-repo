**FR1**: The existing Header component will integrate a language toggle button that switches between Japanese and English content states without page reload, maintaining current navigation menu structure and dropdown functionality.

**FR2**: The Hero component will dynamically render bilingual titles, subtitles, and button text based on React Context language state, preserving existing Framer Motion animations and responsive design patterns.

**FR3**: The system will load bilingual content from a single JSON structure organized by component hierarchy, enabling simultaneous content updates for both languages through one source file.

**FR4**: Navigation menu items, dropdown categories, and contact information in the Header will display in the selected language while maintaining existing hover effects and mobile responsiveness.

**FR5**: Footer component will render bilingual contact details, quick links, social media labels, and map information without breaking existing grid layout or external integrations.

**FR6**: Age Groups section will display translated program descriptions (乳児, 年少, 年中, 年長) and class information while preserving existing card layouts and image associations.

**FR7**: About Information section will present school philosophy, educational approach, and facility details in the selected language, maintaining current content structure and visual hierarchy.

**FR8**: Language state will persist during user session through React Context API, allowing users to navigate between pages with consistent language selection.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Enhancement must maintain existing performance characteristics with language switching completing in <200ms and total bundle size increase <1MB.

**NFR2**: Mobile responsiveness must remain equivalent to current desktop experience across all device types, with language toggle accessible on hamburger menu.

**NFR3**: Existing Japanese SEO performance must be preserved with no degradation in search rankings or meta tag effectiveness.

**NFR4**: Content synchronization accuracy must achieve 100% consistency between Japanese and English versions during updates.

**NFR6**: Accessibility standards must be maintained or improved, with language toggle providing appropriate ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1: Existing API Compatibility**: No backend APIs exist; static site generation approach must be preserved without introducing server-side dependencies.

**CR2: Database Schema Compatibility**: JSON-based content storage must integrate with current version control workflow without requiring external database infrastructure.

**CR3: UI/UX Consistency**: New bilingual content must render using existing Tailwind CSS classes and Framer Motion patterns without visual design changes.
