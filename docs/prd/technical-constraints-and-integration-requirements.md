# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: JavaScript (transitioning to TypeScript), CSS (via Tailwind utilities)  
**Frameworks**: React 18+, Next.js 13+ with App Router, Tailwind CSS 3.x, Framer Motion 6+  
**Database**: Static JSON files in version control (no external database)  
**Infrastructure**: Static site generation with Vercel/Netlify deployment, edge computing distribution  
**External Dependencies**: tailwind-merge for class management, clsx for conditional styling, no external APIs or translation services

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Create `/content/` directory with structured JSON files (`content.json`, `navigation.json`) integrated into Git workflow. Content loading through Next.js static imports at build time, eliminating runtime database queries and maintaining current deployment simplicity.

**API Integration Strategy**: No API integration required. Content delivery through React Context API for state management and component prop interfaces for content consumption. Static site generation approach preserved without introducing server-side dependencies.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: React Context Provider wrapping App Router layout component, making language state available to all child components. Existing component prop patterns extended to accept bilingual content objects (`content.hero.ja` vs `content.hero.en`) without breaking current prop interfaces.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Jest configuration to include bilingual content validation, component rendering tests with both language states, and integration tests for language switching functionality using React Testing Library patterns.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: 
```
/content/
  ├── content.json          # Main bilingual content
  ├── navigation.json       # Menu and navigation items
/src/contexts/
  ├── LanguageContext.tsx   # React Context for language state
/src/utils/
  ├── contentLoader.ts      # Content loading utilities
  ├── cn.ts                 # Existing Tailwind merge utility
```

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing camelCase for React components, kebab-case for file names. Bilingual content keys use language suffix pattern (`titleJa`, `titleEn`) for clarity and type safety.

**Coding Standards**: Maintain current TypeScript adoption patterns, continue Tailwind-first styling approach, preserve Framer Motion animation patterns. All new code follows existing ESLint configuration and Prettier formatting rules.

**Documentation Standards**: Update existing CLAUDE.md files with bilingual implementation patterns, maintain component prop interface documentation, include content structure examples for school staff reference.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Content JSON files processed during Next.js build phase, with validation scripts ensuring translation completeness. No changes to existing build commands (`npm run build`) or deployment pipeline.

**Deployment Strategy**: Maintain current static site deployment approach with no infrastructure changes. Language toggle functionality works entirely client-side, requiring no server-side configuration or environment variables.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing client-side error handling to include language switching errors, content loading failures, and performance monitoring for bilingual content delivery. No external monitoring services required.

**Configuration Management**: Language configuration managed through JSON files in version control, avoiding external configuration systems. Default language and available languages defined in content structure rather than environment variables.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- JSON file size growth could impact performance; mitigated by content validation and monitoring with 100KB size limit enforcement
- Client-side language switching could fail silently; addressed with error boundaries and fallback content loading
- Browser compatibility issues with React Context API; resolved through existing browser support matrix and polyfill strategy

**Integration Risks**:
- Component prop interface changes could break existing functionality; mitigated through comprehensive testing and backward-compatible prop design
- Content structure changes could affect build process; addressed through JSON schema validation and build-time error checking

**Deployment Risks**:
- Invalid JSON content could break site build; prevented through pre-commit validation hooks and content schema enforcement
- Language toggle could conflict with existing JavaScript; resolved through namespace isolation and testing coverage

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive test suite covering all language switching scenarios
- Gradual rollout with feature flags for language toggle functionality
- Content validation workflow with school staff training and approval process
- Performance monitoring with defined rollback triggers and procedures
