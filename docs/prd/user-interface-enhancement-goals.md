# User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The bilingual UI elements will seamlessly integrate with the established Kodomo Gakuen design system through these approaches:

**Design Pattern Consistency**: Language toggle will follow existing button patterns using Tailwind classes (`bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700`) matching current call-to-action styling. Toggle positioning in header will align with existing contact information layout without disrupting navigation hierarchy.

**Component Library Integration**: All bilingual content will render through existing React components (Hero, Header, Footer, AgeGroups) without modifying their visual structure. Props interface expansion will supply translated content while preserving current Tailwind CSS class applications and Framer Motion animation configurations.

**Responsive Design Harmony**: Mobile language toggle will integrate into existing hamburger menu system, maintaining current mobile navigation patterns. Desktop toggle will appear alongside existing header elements using established grid layout and spacing utilities.

**Typography and Color Preservation**: Japanese and English content will use identical typography scales, color schemes, and spacing defined in current Tailwind configuration, ensuring visual consistency regardless of language selection.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

**Modified Components Only** (No new screens required):

- **Header Component**: Addition of language toggle button integrated into existing navigation layout
- **Hero Section**: Dynamic content rendering for titles, subtitles, and buttons based on language state  
- **Navigation Menus**: Dropdown menu items and labels will display translated versions
- **Footer Component**: Contact information, links, and social media labels in selected language
- **Age Groups Section**: Program descriptions and class information with bilingual content
- **About Information Section**: School philosophy and educational approach content translation

**No New Pages/Routes**: Enhancement maintains current page structure and Next.js App Router implementation without adding new routes or navigation destinations.

### UI Consistency Requirements

**Visual Element Preservation**: Language switching must not cause layout shifts, element repositioning, or visual flickering. Content containers will maintain identical dimensions and spacing across both languages.

**Animation Continuity**: Existing Framer Motion animations (page transitions, hover effects, loading states) will continue functioning identically in both languages, with animation timing and easing curves unchanged.

**Interactive Element Consistency**: All buttons, links, form elements, and interactive components will maintain current hover states, focus indicators, and accessibility features regardless of language selection.

**Mobile Experience Parity**: Language toggle functionality will provide equivalent user experience across all device types, with touch targets meeting current accessibility standards and mobile navigation patterns preserved.

**Loading State Management**: Language switching will provide immediate visual feedback using existing loading state patterns if any processing delay occurs, maintaining user experience expectations.
