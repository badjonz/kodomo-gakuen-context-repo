# Intro Project Analysis and Context

### SCOPE ASSESSMENT CONFIRMATION

Based on the comprehensive project brief, this **IS** a significant enhancement requiring this full PRD process because:

- **Multiple coordinated stories required** (3+ development phases)
- **Architectural planning needed** (React Context API, component integration patterns)
- **Substantial codebase integration** (Header, Hero, Footer, Age Groups components)
- **Risk assessment crucial** (content synchronization, performance impact)

✅ **Full PRD process is appropriate for this enhancement.**

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis combined with comprehensive project brief and CLAUDE.md documentation

**Current Project State**: 
Kodomo Gakuen operates a modern React/Next.js bilingual preschool website serving the Higashi Yamato area and Yokota Air Base international community. The site currently functions as a Japanese-only static frontend built with:
- **Framework**: React 18+ with Next.js 13+ App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with tailwind-merge utility
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for declarative transitions
- **Architecture**: Component-based with sections (Hero, AgeGroups, AboutInfo) and layouts (Header, Footer)
- **Content**: Hardcoded Japanese content requiring bilingual expansion

### Available Documentation Analysis

✅ **Available Documentation:**
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (CLAUDE.md comprehensive)
- ✅ Source Tree/Architecture (Component structure documented)
- ✅ Coding Standards (Tailwind + TypeScript patterns)
- ✅ API Documentation (Static site, no APIs)
- ✅ External API Documentation (No external APIs)
- ❌ UX/UI Guidelines (Implicit through Tailwind usage)
- ❌ Technical Debt Documentation (Minimal for new codebase)
- ✅ **Other**: Comprehensive project brief with user research and success metrics

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ **New Feature Addition** - Adding bilingual functionality to existing Japanese-only website

**Enhancement Description**: 
Implement client-side bilingual toggle system using React state management that seamlessly switches between Japanese and English content without page reloads, utilizing single JSON content source for maintenance efficiency while preserving existing component architecture and user experience.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ **Moderate Impact** - Component props will be modified to accept bilingual content, but existing component structure and styling remain unchanged

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
• Increase international family enrollment by 30% within 6 months
• Reduce administrative translation requests by 75% within 3 months  
• Achieve instant language switching without page reloads or performance degradation
• Maintain current Japanese SEO performance and user experience
• Enable single-source content management reducing maintenance overhead by 50%

**Background Context:**
The Kodomo Gakuen website currently operates exclusively in Japanese, creating accessibility barriers for international families in the Higashi Yamato area, particularly military families from Yokota Air Base. Despite offering bilingual education programs, the school's web presence doesn't reflect this capability, resulting in lost enrollment opportunities and increased administrative burden for staff providing individual translation assistance. The enhancement addresses this gap by implementing a maintenance-efficient bilingual system that preserves the site's Japanese-primary character while making critical information accessible to English-speaking families.
