### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ **New Feature Addition** - Adding bilingual functionality to existing Japanese-only website

**Enhancement Description**: 
Implement client-side bilingual toggle system using React state management that seamlessly switches between Japanese and English content without page reloads, utilizing single JSON content source for maintenance efficiency while preserving existing component architecture and user experience.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ **Moderate Impact** - Component props will be modified to accept bilingual content, but existing component structure and styling remain unchanged

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
• Increase international family enrollment by 30% within 6 months
• Reduce administrative translation requests by 75% within 3 months  
• Achieve instant language switching without page reloads or performance degradation
• Maintain current Japanese SEO performance and user experience
• Enable single-source content management reducing maintenance overhead by 50%

**Background Context:**
The Kodomo Gakuen website currently operates exclusively in Japanese, creating accessibility barriers for international families in the Higashi Yamato area, particularly military families from Yokota Air Base. Despite offering bilingual education programs, the school's web presence doesn't reflect this capability, resulting in lost enrollment opportunities and increased administrative burden for staff providing individual translation assistance. The enhancement addresses this gap by implementing a maintenance-efficient bilingual system that preserves the site's Japanese-primary character while making critical information accessible to English-speaking families.

**CR3: UI/UX Consistency**: New bilingual content must render using existing Tailwind CSS classes and Framer Motion patterns without visual design changes.

**CR4: Integration Compatibility**: React Context API implementation must work seamlessly with existing component prop patterns and Next.js App Router structure.

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The bilingual UI elements will seamlessly integrate with the established Kodomo Gakuen design system through these approaches:

**Design Pattern Consistency**: Language toggle will follow existing button patterns using Tailwind classes (`bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700`) matching current call-to-action styling. Toggle positioning in header will align with existing contact information layout without disrupting navigation hierarchy.

**Component Library Integration**: All bilingual content will render through existing React components (Hero, Header, Footer, AgeGroups) without modifying their visual structure. Props interface expansion will supply translated content while preserving current Tailwind CSS class applications and Framer Motion animation configurations.

**Responsive Design Harmony**: Mobile language toggle will integrate into existing hamburger menu system, maintaining current mobile navigation patterns. Desktop toggle will appear alongside existing header elements using established grid layout and spacing utilities.

**Typography and Color Preservation**: Japanese and English content will use identical typography scales, color schemes, and spacing defined in current Tailwind configuration, ensuring visual consistency regardless of language selection.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

**Modified Components Only** (No new screens required):

- **Header Component**: Addition of language toggle button integrated into existing navigation layout
- **Hero Section**: Dynamic content rendering for titles, subtitles, and buttons based on language state  
- **Navigation Menus**: Dropdown menu items and labels will display translated versions
- **Footer Component**: Contact information, links, and social media labels in selected language
- **Age Groups Section**: Program descriptions and class information with bilingual content
- **About Information Section**: School philosophy and educational approach content translation

**No New Pages/Routes**: Enhancement maintains current page structure and Next.js App Router implementation without adding new routes or navigation destinations.

### UI Consistency Requirements

**Visual Element Preservation**: Language switching must not cause layout shifts, element repositioning, or visual flickering. Content containers will maintain identical dimensions and spacing across both languages.

**Animation Continuity**: Existing Framer Motion animations (page transitions, hover effects, loading states) will continue functioning identically in both languages, with animation timing and easing curves unchanged.

**Interactive Element Consistency**: All buttons, links, form elements, and interactive components will maintain current hover states, focus indicators, and accessibility features regardless of language selection.

**Mobile Experience Parity**: Language toggle functionality will provide equivalent user experience across all device types, with touch targets meeting current accessibility standards and mobile navigation patterns preserved.

**Loading State Management**: Language switching will provide immediate visual feedback using existing loading state patterns if any processing delay occurs, maintaining user experience expectations.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: JavaScript (transitioning to TypeScript), CSS (via Tailwind utilities)  
**Frameworks**: React 18+, Next.js 13+ with App Router, Tailwind CSS 3.x, Framer Motion 6+  
**Database**: Static JSON files in version control (no external database)  
**Infrastructure**: Static site generation with Vercel/Netlify deployment, edge computing distribution  
**External Dependencies**: tailwind-merge for class management, clsx for conditional styling, no external APIs or translation services

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Create `/content/` directory with structured JSON files (`content.json`, `navigation.json`) integrated into Git workflow. Content loading through Next.js static imports at build time, eliminating runtime database queries and maintaining current deployment simplicity.

**API Integration Strategy**: No API integration required. Content delivery through React Context API for state management and component prop interfaces for content consumption. Static site generation approach preserved without introducing server-side dependencies.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: React Context Provider wrapping App Router layout component, making language state available to all child components. Existing component prop patterns extended to accept bilingual content objects (`content.hero.ja` vs `content.hero.en`) without breaking current prop interfaces.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Jest configuration to include bilingual content validation, component rendering tests with both language states, and integration tests for language switching functionality using React Testing Library patterns.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: 
```
/content/
  ├── content.json          # Main bilingual content
  ├── navigation.json       # Menu and navigation items
/src/contexts/
  ├── LanguageContext.tsx   # React Context for language state
/src/utils/
  ├── contentLoader.ts      # Content loading utilities
  ├── cn.ts                 # Existing Tailwind merge utility
```

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing camelCase for React components, kebab-case for file names. Bilingual content keys use language suffix pattern (`titleJa`, `titleEn`) for clarity and type safety.

**Coding Standards**: Maintain current TypeScript adoption patterns, continue Tailwind-first styling approach, preserve Framer Motion animation patterns. All new code follows existing ESLint configuration and Prettier formatting rules.

**Documentation Standards**: Update existing CLAUDE.md files with bilingual implementation patterns, maintain component prop interface documentation, include content structure examples for school staff reference.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Content JSON files processed during Next.js build phase, with validation scripts ensuring translation completeness. No changes to existing build commands (`npm run build`) or deployment pipeline.

**Deployment Strategy**: Maintain current static site deployment approach with no infrastructure changes. Language toggle functionality works entirely client-side, requiring no server-side configuration or environment variables.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing client-side error handling to include language switching errors, content loading failures, and performance monitoring for bilingual content delivery. No external monitoring services required.

**Configuration Management**: Language configuration managed through JSON files in version control, avoiding external configuration systems. Default language and available languages defined in content structure rather than environment variables.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- JSON file size growth could impact performance; mitigated by content validation and monitoring with 100KB size limit enforcement
- Client-side language switching could fail silently; addressed with error boundaries and fallback content loading
- Browser compatibility issues with React Context API; resolved through existing browser support matrix and polyfill strategy

**Integration Risks**:
- Component prop interface changes could break existing functionality; mitigated through comprehensive testing and backward-compatible prop design
- Content structure changes could affect build process; addressed through JSON schema validation and build-time error checking

**Deployment Risks**:
- Invalid JSON content could break site build; prevented through pre-commit validation hooks and content schema enforcement
- Language toggle could conflict with existing JavaScript; resolved through namespace isolation and testing coverage

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive test suite covering all language switching scenarios
- Gradual rollout with feature flags for language toggle functionality
- Content validation workflow with school staff training and approval process
- Performance monitoring with defined rollback triggers and procedures
