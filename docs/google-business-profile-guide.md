---

## Business Information Setup

### Primary Information

**Business Name:**
```
こども学園 / Kodomo Gakuen
```
**Important:** Use exact name that appears on storefront signage and website. Do NOT stuff keywords into the name (against Google guidelines).

**Business Category (Primary):**
- **Preschool** (保育園)

**Additional Categories (Add up to 9):**
- **Day care center** (託児所)
- **Kindergarten** (幼稚園)
- **Child care agency** (子育て支援)

**Why Multiple Categories:**
- Parents use different search terms
- Increases visibility in various searches
- Captures both "hoikuen" and "youchien" searches

### Address and Contact

**Address (Must match website exactly):**
```
2-409 Narahashi, Higashiyamato, Tokyo 207-0031
```

**Japanese Address:**
```
〒207-0031
東京都東大和市奈良橋2丁目409番地
```

**Phone Number:**
```
+81-42-590-3715
```
**Note:** Use international format for consistency with website structured data.

**Alternative Format:**
```
042-590-3715
```
**Note:** Local format also acceptable, but must match website NAP exactly.

**Website URL:**
```
https://www.kodomogakuen.com
```

**Email (if adding):**
```
info@kodomogakuen.com
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL: NAP Consistency**

The address, phone, and business name **MUST** match exactly across:
- Google Business Profile
- Website footer
- Website contact page
- JSON-LD structured data
- Facebook page
- Instagram bio
- All local directories

Even small differences (e.g., "2-409" vs "2-409-0") can hurt local SEO rankings.

### Service Area

**Option 1: Physical Location**
- Customers visit your business location
- Select: "Yes, I serve customers at my business address"

**Option 2: Service Area**
- If you also offer pickup/delivery services
- Add service radius or specific cities

**Recommended for Kodomo Gakuen:**
- Physical location: Yes (parents visit for tours, drop-off)
- Service area: Add nearby cities where families commute from:
  - 東村山市 (Higashi Murayama)
  - 武蔵村山市 (Musashi Murayama)
  - 小平市 (Kodaira)
  - 所沢市 (Tokorozawa)
  - 立川市 (Tachikawa)

## Reviews Management

### Why Reviews Matter

- **Trust:** 88% of parents trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations
- **Rankings:** Review quantity and quality impact local search rankings
- **Conversion:** More reviews = higher click-through and enrollment rates

### Encouraging Reviews

**Ethical Methods:**
1. **After Enrollment:** Send follow-up email thanking parents, gently requesting review
2. **At Events:** During open houses, mention "If you enjoyed the tour, we'd appreciate a review"
3. **Email Signature:** Include link to Google review page
4. **QR Code:** Print QR code linking to review page, display at reception

**Direct Review Link:**
```
https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=YOUR_PLACE_ID
```
(Find your Place ID in Google Business Profile dashboard)

**⚠️ DO NOT:**
- Offer incentives for reviews (against Google policy)
- Write fake reviews
- Ask family/friends to post fake reviews
- Review-swap with other businesses
- Delete negative reviews (respond instead)
